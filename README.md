# Aim-Rehab

## Background

Aim-Rehab is a point and click style game in which the user must use their mouse to either click on or follow objects on their screen. Their score will be calculated based on the number of either targets clicks or percentage of time they are able to keep their mouse over the target. Each round will last 60 seconds and the user will be able to choose from different difficulties to challenge themselves appropriately. 

The idea behind the rehab in the name is that it is also intended to help patients in hand therapy with their skills in fine motor control and hand eye coordiantion. The 60 second rounds are an appropriate duration per exercise set, and keeping score will allow them to quantitatively track their progress. It will provide a fun and interactive way to approach therapy to keep patients engaged and seeking personal improvement.
